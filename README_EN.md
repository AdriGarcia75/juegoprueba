### side note: check translation

## Descripción
The aim of this project is to develop a small videogame in Java implementing OOP, where there player controls a character that is from a predetermined class, such as a warrior or a cleric. Each character has attributes like attack, health and speed, this last one being the one that defines the order of attacks in fights.

The main objective of this game is to beat some monsters whose difficulty gets progressively harder as the character advances. Monsters give out experience when beaten, allowing the character to level up and improve their's base stats. Each character has a stat of how many monsters it has beaten too.

Monsters, when beaten, drop gold coins that the player can use in a shop. This shop offers weapons that increase the attack power of the character, as well as potions that cure a percentage of health of the character. The weapons also have some more elaborated perks, and will increase the attack attribute of the character, and the potions will simply be of a one time use.

When the character levels up, the shop resets itself with new items, which will be more powerful as the player advances throughout the game.

The program must be accesible through the terminal and offer a menu with some options for the player.
